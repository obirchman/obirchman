- 👋 Hi, I’m @obirchman
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Learning everything! Maybe branching out? So Anything not atmega328p.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Bootloaders, Python, wireless communication, UIs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... autonomous household device. Or as I like to call it Über-roomba.

- I try to learn through projecting but it can be hard to come up with meaningful projects so any ideas on that
- is always welcome or if you want help with something for whatever reason I gladly take a look at it but no
- promises!

- Hope you find something of value in my repos. Still very much a work in progress though.
