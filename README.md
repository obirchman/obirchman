- 👋 Hi, I’m @obirchman
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... way too much! I don't have trouble working, I have trouble not working and
- more specifically not working on the wrong things!
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... in school about sensors, measurements and also about wireless protocols and
- technology. In my spare time I'm mostly trying to learn some more Python and version control.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... autonomous household device. Or as I like to call it Über-roomba. I did see a
- interesting concept for making a stirling engine...

- Currently working on documenting my courses on github.
- Also working on a solution similar to arduino. Using a atmega328p, bluetooth and python script on PC to repgram it
- wirelessly.

- A bit nervous about using github to make my work public not only from a privacy perspective 
- but also because it's embarassing.
