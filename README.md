- 👋 Hi, I’m @obirchman
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... every day items. I think it's super interesting to try and solve what is really simple problems
- when you do them manually but it gets really complicated when you wanna solve them using digital technology. Like riding a bike,
- doing laundry or just picking things up. And solve them in a manner that would be plausible for every day life.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... in school about sensors, measurements and also about wireless protocols and
- technology. In my spare time I'm mostly trying to learn some more Python, version control and the mechanical
- side of things.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything with a motor. Especially something that turns rotary motion into a linear motion
- because I have a hard time grasping the mechanical part of the problem.
-
- Currently working on:
- Documenting my courses on github.
- Also working on a solution similar to arduino in order to learn more about AVR SPM and bootloaders.
